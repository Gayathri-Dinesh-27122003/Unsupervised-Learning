# Unsupervised-Learning

This repository serves as a hub for showcasing works on unsupervised learning techniques, specifically focusing on clustering and association algorithms.

What is Unsupervised Learning?

Unsupervised learning represents a fundamental branch of machine learning where algorithms autonomously identify patterns and structures within input data without explicit supervision or labeled responses. Unlike supervised learning paradigms, where models are trained using labeled data, unsupervised learning tasks involve exploring the data to uncover hidden relationships or structures. Common tasks within unsupervised learning encompass clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule mining.

This repository primarily revolves around two key areas within the realm of unsupervised learning:

Clustering
Clustering stands as a pivotal technique for grouping similar data points together based on shared features or characteristics. Within this repository, you'll encounter works centered on two prominent clustering algorithms:

K-Means Clustering: This centroid-based algorithm partitions data into K distinct clusters based on proximity to centroids.
Hierarchical Clustering: Operating by recursively merging or splitting clusters based on similarity, hierarchical clustering forms a hierarchy of clusters.

Association
Association rule learning constitutes another vital facet of unsupervised learning, focusing on the discovery of intriguing relationships between variables within extensive datasets. The repository features implementations and discussions on two noteworthy association algorithms:

Apriori Algorithm: A classic approach to frequent itemset mining, widely applied in market basket analysis and beyond.
Éclat Algorithm: Known for its efficiency, particularly with sparse datasets, Éclat serves as an alternative method for mining frequent itemsets.
